              <p>The American Dream has many shapes and sizes, to be a good husband 
              or wife, to be a good worker, and finally, to live a lavish lifestyle. 
              However, I believe that the true American Dream is to be successful. 
              Hi, my name is <strong>Sragvi Vadali</strong>, and I believe that we,
              as American citizens, can achieve this goal by living the lifestyle 
              in which we are happy in. I believe that I can achieve this dream by 
              first going to the college I want. I believe that I can achieve 
              this goal by going to the workforce I like. For me, I want to go to 
              a good college like Berkeley, LA, or Irvine. I would enroll in the 
              College of Engineering or College of Computer Science there, starting 
              my pathway to my career. I will work hard and become a major impact 
              on the history of the school I choose to go to. Finally, I will do a
              Masters and a Ph.D. of Business and Computer Science, ending my 
              pathway at Google, Salesforce, or Workday.</p>

               <p>Even though I am a freshman at Dublin High School (DHS), I 
               believe that I have many skills that I can place on the table. Last 
               year, I tutored two young 6th graders. They were failing in their classes, 
               I was picked to mentor both of them, giving them most of my time and effort. 
               At the end, I was able to bring their grades up to a passing grade, 
               even having one of them receive a 3.0 GPA. This helped me in life. 
               I used the skills I learned from mentoring the students in order 
               to be able to help others, not just in school work, but in life lessons as well. </p>
             </div>
             <div>
               <p>Aside from that, I consider myself to be a multipotentialite. A multipotentialite is “someone with many interests and creative pursuits”.  I like many subjects, such as, math, science, marine biology, aeronautical engineering, physics, and robotics. I am currently in Dublin High’s Vex Robotics competition team, 5327 B. With my teammates, we are building, and coding a robot that will be able to flip caps, hit flags with a ball, and place caps on a pole. This a challenging project, since we have limitations such as metal amount, defined maximum amount of motors at eight, and finally, a new coding software that we are recently learning. Since I am a freshman, I believe that I need to learn and understand Vex Robotics by discussing it with the upperclassmen. This will help we shape my path in robotics. I also am a member of other clubs such as the DHS Cricket Club, Dublin DECA, The Envirotech Club, and finally, Speech and Debate. I can currently working on a robot that is using a shape and attributes of marine life to help with underwater exploration. With the help of Mr. Kaehms, the teacher in charge of the Envirotech Club, and the many lessons I learn from that club, I believe that I can create a robot that can fulfil my expectations for my science fair project this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this information about who I am and my goals for the future. Feel free to email me if you have any questions. You can email me at: reachsragvi@gmail.com. Hope you have a nice week. </p>
