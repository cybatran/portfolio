              <p>My name is Sragvi Vadali. I am currently a <strong>freshman</strong> 
                 at Dublin High School, in Dublin, California. Like many others,
                 I enjoy to do many extracurricular activities such as playing sports, 
                 clubs, and much more hobbies. For example, I like to bake, swim, 
                 play cricket and play basketball. I am currectly in the Dublin High Cricket team. 
                 I am also in the Dublin High Gael Force Robotics. Outside of Robotics, 
                 I enjoy coding websites, playing music and hanging out with my family. 
                 I play the piano, alto saxophone, and violin. I enjoy many things, 
                 and I have a passion to many miscellaneous topics. This is why 
                 I am a multipotentialite, because I enjoy to do many things in 
                 all of the sides of the spectrum.
