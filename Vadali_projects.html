                <div style = "margin-top:40px"><p> For this Scratch game, I needed to retrace 
                      my coding skills. Even though I have past knowledge of this language, 
                      I have not used it in many years, bringing me back to square one.
                      With my partner, Diego van Schie, I learned many things such as how 
                      to randomize the location of my character. I also learned the value 
                      of teamwork. Even though we only had the instructions of building a 
                      <strong>multi-level project,</strong> we worked together creating a 
                      fun game. We, however, had many ideas beforehand, finally deciding to 
                      choose a game about a wizard fighting his partner, and evil rouge wizard. 
                      The main character's powers slowly progress, leading to him having a 
                      "warping power", that allowed him to teleport around the map,and a lazer 
                      that will move to the location of the mouse. From each level, the 
                      character will gain one power at a time, making each level gradually difficult. At the end, we 
                      learned many values such as coding skills, teamwork, and the power of

                  <div><p><strong>Objective:</strong> The client wants an automated 
                  process to apply to images. They want the process to use some 
                  combination of masking, shading, or combining the images with a 
                  consistent logo or superimposed image. The client enjoys abstract 
                  art as well and might like geometric shapes incorporated in the 
                  image – drawn on, as a border, or as a mask. The client enjoys 
                  participating in the creative process and will appreciate being 
                  offered a range of options (as a parameter) for one of the image

                    <!--This is where I explain what I learned, who I did it with, and how the game is played-->
                    <div style = "margin-top:40px"><p> The design process was fairly
                    simply. We started the project by creating a brainstorming chart 
                    and the constraints of the project. This allowed us to be able to
                    imagine the code in our head. After that, we created a template 
                    on how we wanted to do the images as well as what the images will 
                    look like. We were happy with our templates and started working 
                    right away. With Loic’s prior knowledge, we were able to create 
                    a strong basis for our images and what we need to work on. 
                    However, we made the code to complex that we didn’t understand
                    a way to perfectly streamline the code. This made it a little
                    more challenging. However, we were able to use the design process
                    and create a good image manipulator. I also learned many concepts
                    in Environmental Sciences. We were also able to develop on each 
                    other’s strengths. Since Loic is a senior, he has more research 
                    skills than me, causing it it be easier debug and create new ideas.
                    Ultimately both of those actions led to positive ideas for the 
                    project but the whole process would have been more streamlined 
                    had we better communicated our intentions to each other. At the 
                    end, we learned the need of teamwork and
