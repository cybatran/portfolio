                <div style = "margin-top:40px"><p> For this Scratch game, I needed to retrace 
                      my coding skills. Even though I had knowledge of this language, 
                      I have not used it in many years, bringing me back to square one.
                      With my partner, Diego van Schie, I learned many things such as how 
                      to randomize the location of my character. I also learned the value 
                      of teamwork. Even though we only had the instructions of building a 
                      <strong>multi-level project,</strong> we worked together creating a 
                      fun game. We however, had many ideas beforehand, we decided to 
                      choose a game about a wizard that is fighting another wizard that is evil. 
                      The main character's powers slowly progress, leading to him having a 
                      "warping power", that allowed him to teleport around the map, a lazer 
                      that will move to the location of the mouse. From each level, the 
                      character will gain one power at a time, making the level more difficult. At the end, we 
                      learned many values such as coding skills, teamwork, and the power of
